# mini-project
This project goal is to build an extensible and fully reproducible system to analyze multiple datasets, with various Machine Learning techniques.

[description of the program (what it does, Pyton program, on terminal, etc...)]

This work must be fully reproducible and extensible. The user can easily install and run the packages on his working environment to recreate the results of our analysis. And of course the program must implement unit testing and continuous integration to ensure an efficient development method and a better quality control.
