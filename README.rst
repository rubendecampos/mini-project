==========
 **SaRu**
==========

This project goal is to build an extensible and fully reproducible system 
to analyze multiple datasets, with various Machine Learning techniques.

Saru is a small software that compute the absolute mean error of an algorithm that
predict the quality of a wine or the price of a house using different machine
learning techniques.
It is a python program that can be use through any basic terminal.

This work must be fully reproducible and extensible. The user can easily 
install and run the packages on his working environment to recreate the results 
of our analysis. And of course the program must implement unit testing and 
continuous integration to ensure an efficient development method and a better 
quality control.


How to reproduce this work
---------------------------

To reproduce this work, you need to :

* Have a basic understanding of command lines
* Have python (version >=3.8, <3.10) and pip installed

Then follow the `installation <https://rubendecampos.github.io/mini-project/installation>`_
process to install our package from PyPi and read the 
`user guide <https://rubendecampos.github.io/mini-project/user_guide>`_ to run the 
experiment and see the results of
our analysis.

If you have trouble running our code try the help command::

   $ saru-run -h

If you still have problem to run our code or found any bugs, don't hesitate
to report an issue, it will help us improve our code and make it more extensible.
