This project goal is to build an extensible and fully reproducible system 
to analyze multiple datasets, with various Machine Learning techniques.

[description of the program (what it does, Pyton program, on terminal, etc...)]


This work must be fully reproducible and extensible. The user can easily 
install and run the packages on his working environment to recreate the results 
of our analysis. And of course the program must implement unit testing and 
continuous integration to ensure an efficient development method and a better 
quality control.
